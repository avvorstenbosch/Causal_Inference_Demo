# Causal_Inference_Demo
This repo is dedicated to a simple demonstration of the efficacy of causal inference on a  toy dataset
At the same time, this demo was used to explore the posibilities of Rmd and beamer to knit a .Rmd file straight to a Usable Presentation. in .PDF format.

We use BRMS to retrofit the parameters of a synthetic dataset we designed ourselves.
Next, we explore using the same model on a real dataset, to explore how this could be used to make informed decisions for policy makers.
For a nice presentation on the results, check out `main.pdf`, for the full code with comments, check out `main.rmd`
